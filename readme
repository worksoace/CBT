# CBT Exam System

I built this project for my students that I teach math. It’s a simple computer-based test (CBT) system where they can log in, take a basic test, and get results instantly. You can adapt it for any subject.

## Features

* Add students & set passwords
* Add multiple-choice questions
* Store and view results automatically

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/worksoace/CBT.git
   ```
2. Import the provided `cbt.sql` into MySQL/MariaDB.
3. Edit `config.php` with your database credentials.
4. Place the project in your web server directory.



## Sample SQL – Add Students

```sql
INSERT INTO students (student_name, username, password)
VALUES
('John Doe', 'john123', 'pass123'),
('Mary Jane', 'maryj', 'pass456');
```

## Sample SQL – Add Exam Questions

```sql
INSERT INTO questions (question_text, option_a, option_b, option_c, option_d, correct_option)
VALUES
('What is 2 + 2?', '3', '4', '5', '6', 'B'),
('Solve: 5 × 3', '8', '15', '10', '20', 'B');
```
